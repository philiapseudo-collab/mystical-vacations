This document establishes the technical, architectural, and design parameters for the Mystical Vacations luxury travel booking platform. All code generated by the AI assistant must strictly adhere to these decisions, prioritizing scalability, high performance, and a premium user experience.
1. Project Identity & Non-Negotiable Constraints ✨AspectConstraint/DecisionRationaleBrand Goal"Mystical Luxury" - Cinematic, exclusive, minimalist.Elevates the perceived value of Kenyan/Tanzanian travel experiences.Color PalettePrimary: #0A192F (Deep Navy). Accent: #D4AF37 (Muted Gold).Ensures a high-contrast, premium, and sophisticated visual identity.Image StandardCinematic 4K/HDR. NO generic stock photography.Critical for the "creative and beautiful" aesthetic.Core FunctionEnd-to-End Journey Builder. Not just static booking.Facilitates complex, multi-modal itinerary creation (Kenya/Tanzania).
2. Technical Architecture Decisions 🛠️A. Frontend StackFramework: Next.js 15 (App Router) and TypeScript (Strict Mode).Styling: Tailwind CSS (for utility-first speed) with a custom tailwind.config.ts enforcing the established color palette.Animations: Framer Motion (Used exclusively for subtle transitions and hovers, avoiding distraction).B. Backend / API StrategyArchitecture: Mock Node.js/Express/TypeScript layer acting as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF).Data Models: Must define clear, exhaustive TypeScript Interfaces (e.g., ITransportSearchResponse, IExcursionDetails).SGR Abstraction (Crucial): The API must abstract the complexities of local SGR (Standard Gauge Railway) booking/payment (e.g., M-Pesa). The user pays via standard gateway; the API handles the complex proxy logic internally.
3. Core Component Requirements 🗺️ComponentKey Feature/ConstraintOmni-Search BarCentralized home page component. Must offer four tabs: Packages, Accommodation, Transport, Excursions.Transport ResultsMust display and compare two multi-modal options side-by-side: Flight and SGR Train (with First/Economy class options).Booking FlowMax 3 Steps after search (Search > Review > Book). Must include a persistent, live Price Breakdown Widget on the sidebar to maintain transparency.Excursion ListingsUse a responsive, visually appealing grid (masonry if beneficial). Must include a Sticky Filter Sidebar for filtering by location, price, and activity type (Safari, Culture, Beach).
4. Development Guidance for AI AssistantPriority 1: Type Safety. Ensure all components and API interactions are robustly typed.Priority 2: Performance. Optimize component rendering and data fetching (use caching strategies where sensible, even in mock APIs).Quality: Generate clean, modern code that reflects 30 years of best-practice experience. Avoid boilerplate; favor scalable, reusable code patterns.
